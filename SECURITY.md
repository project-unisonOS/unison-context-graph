# Security

The context-graph service is part of the UnisonOS core and processes contextual signals for personalization and recall.

For overall security and privacy guidance (including how context and traces are handled), see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in the context-graph service, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
